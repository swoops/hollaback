# Hollaback

This is a simple API to save and check callback URLs. Eventually I will hack it
up to have features.

# Security
None! This is alpha still. It only has half of a feature and is ugly. Also I
plan on redoing most the SQL stuff so it will need another complete tests. If
someone finds problems please send them my way.

# Install
I discourage installing this right now. It is only public to allow easy
feedback.

# TODO
Somewhat ordered.
* Overhaul database junk before it's too late!
* Allow clients to see information about callback visits.
* Install Scripts
* Dockerfile
* Add LOTS of features.
